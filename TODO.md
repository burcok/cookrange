## Version Control Strategy

### Version Naming Convention
- Major version (x.0.0): Major feature additions or breaking changes
- Minor version (0.x.0): New features without breaking changes
- Patch version (0.0.x): Bug fixes and minor improvements

### Stability Guidelines
- High Stability: Thoroughly tested, production-ready features
- Medium Stability: Tested but may need refinement
- Low Stability: Experimental features, not recommended for production

## Notes
- Each phase should be completed before moving to the next
- Regular testing and code review should be performed throughout
- Documentation should be updated with each new feature
- Performance metrics should be monitored continuously
- Security audits should be performed regularly
- Offline-first approach should be maintained throughout development
- User experience should be prioritized in all features
